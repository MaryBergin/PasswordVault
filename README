Complexity
****************************************

createTable: O(1)
-A simple table creation will always have the same outcome

createNode: O(1)
-Simple node creation will always have the same outcome

DestroyTable: O(N^3)
-The table and it's internal lists must be iterated through and deltetd

InsertData: O(N^5)
-There are several places that the data can be inserted, ie a collision resolution
is needed
